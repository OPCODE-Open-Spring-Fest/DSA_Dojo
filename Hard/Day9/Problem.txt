Marin and Gojou are engaged in a game of hide-and-seek with an array.

Gojou begins by taking the following steps:

First, he selects two integers, l and r, where l is less than or equal to r.

Next, Gojou creates an array a of length r−l+1, which is a permutation of the sequence [l,l+1,…,r].

Then, he chooses a secret integer, x, and updates each element ai of the array a to ai⊕x using the bitwise XOR operation.

Marin's task is to determine the secret integer x, given the values of l, r, and the final array a. She must uncover any possible values of x that could have led to the resulting array a.

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤105) — the number of test cases.

In the first line of each test case contains two integers l and r (0=l≤r<217).

The second line contains r−l+1 integers of a1,a2,…,ar−l+1 (0≤ai<217). It is guaranteed that a can be generated using the steps performed by Gojou.

It is guaranteed that the sum of r−l+1 over all test cases does not exceed 217.
